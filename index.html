                            Riding along the Kelambakkam Bypass was simple but refreshing. The gentle breeze on my face made me feel lighter, and the quiet streets allowed me to just breathe and focus on the moment. My legs felt a satisfying rhythm as I pedaled, not too tired but pleasantly awake. I noticed small details—the sunlight filtering through trees, the occasional café, the calm morning atmosphere. It felt like time slowed down for a while, letting me forget the usual stress. By the end of the ride, I felt relaxed and quietly accomplished. Even a short ride like this reminded me how small moments can recharge your mind.
